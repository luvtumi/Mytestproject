I'm adding some content in here
second line is here just to see if I click enter, it will take me to second line
and this third line is just for me to add as much content as possible.
spectacular here; just populating. 

I just realize i represent insert text
and Esc represent saving my texts
while wq, then enter represent saving my text and exiting.

Thank you.
